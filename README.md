# Backpacking Trip Planner

## Overview

The Backpacking Trip Planner is a full-stack MERN application designed to help users plan and manage their backpacking trips. This project was inspired by my own experience on a Europe trip that turned out to be very disorganized and chaotic when it came to planning. I realized the need for a tool that could streamline the process, making it easier to plan trips and keep everything organized. From the very start of my class, I knew this was the project I wanted to create to help others avoid the hassles I faced and myself with future trips.

With this application, users can create, read, update, and delete trips seamlessly through a React frontend connected to an Express and MongoDB backend. The application also leverages a third-party API to provide enriched information and features.

## Features

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete trips.
- **React Hooks**: Utilizes `useState`, `useEffect`, and other React hooks to manage state and side effects.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a user-friendly experience across different devices.
- **Third-Party API Integration**: Incorporates data from a third-party API to enhance trip planning.
- **Four Key Pages**: Home, Create Trip, Countries, and About.
